	Researched and developed a layout analysis model.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Developed a pipeline and model for identifying strings based on LayoutLMv3, which improved metrics by 20\%
		\item Optimized the model for CPU usage through quantization, resulting in a 50\% increase in speed
		\item Quantized the segmentation model for CPU usage with a speed increase of 3x and for mobile devices with a speed increase of 40\% and a 3x reduction in memory consumption
